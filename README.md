- Basic knowledge of mathematics: proof by induction, proof by contradiction.

#### Courses:

- **Algorithmic Design and Techniques**: Learn how to design algorithms, solve computational problems and implement solutions efficiently.
- **Data Structures Fundamentals**: Learn about data structures that are used in computational thinking – both basic and advanced.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Learn how to use algorithms to explore graphs, compute shortest distance, min spanning tree, and connected components.
- **NP-Complete Problems**: Learn about NP-complete problems, known as hard problems that can’t be solved efficiently, and practice solving them using algorithmic techniques.
- **String Processing and Pattern Matching Algorithms**: Learn about pattern matching and string processing algorithms and how they apply to interesting applications.
- **Dynamic Programming: Applications In Machine Learning and Genomics**: Learn how dynamic programming and Hidden Markov Models can be used to compare genetic strings and uncover evolution.
- **Graph Algorithms in Genome Sequencing**: Learn how graphs are used to assemble millions of pieces of DNA into a contiguous genome and use these genomes to construct a Tree of Life.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures Capstone**: Synthesize your knowledge of algorithms and biology to build your own software for solving a biological challenge.
