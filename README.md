## Programming Language (Python)

### [Introduction to Computing in Python - Edx Professional Certificate - The Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-computing-in-python)

- Average Length: 5 weeks per course
- Effort: 10-11 hours per week, per course
- Number Of Courses:  4 Courses in Program
- Total Average Lenght: 20 weeks
- Price: $229.50 USD for the entire program.

#### Prerequisites:

- This course presupposes no prior knowledge beyond basic arithmetic; knowledge of high school-level algebra, however, is desirable.

#### Courses:

- **Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming**: Learn the fundamentals of computing in Python, including variables, operators, and writing and debugging your own programs.
- **Computing in Python II: Control Structures**: Learn about control structures, one of the most powerful parts of programming. This course covers conditionals, loops, functions, and error handling, specifically in Python but with broader applicability to other languages as well.
- **Computing in Python III: Data Structures**: Learn more complex ways of handling data, including files, lists, and dictionaries for building complex programs.
- **Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms**: Learn about recursion, search and sort algorithms, and object-oriented programming in Python.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

### [Algorithms and Data Structures - Edx MicroMasters Program - UC San Diego](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures)

- Effort:  8-10 hours per week, per course
- Number Of Courses:  8 Courses in Program
- Total Average Lenght: 24-56 weeks
- Price: $1080 USD for the entire program

#### Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of at least one programming language (C,C++,C#,Haskell,Java,JavaScript,Python2/3,Ruby,Scala): loops, arrays, stacks, recursion.
- Basic knowledge of mathematics: proof by induction, proof by contradiction.

#### Courses:

- **Algorithmic Design and Techniques**: Learn how to design algorithms, solve computational problems and implement solutions efficiently.
- **Data Structures Fundamentals**: Learn about data structures that are used in computational thinking – both basic and advanced.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Learn how to use algorithms to explore graphs, compute shortest distance, min spanning tree, and connected components.
- **NP-Complete Problems**: Learn about NP-complete problems, known as hard problems that can’t be solved efficiently, and practice solving them using algorithmic techniques.
- **String Processing and Pattern Matching Algorithms**: Learn about pattern matching and string processing algorithms and how they apply to interesting applications.
- **Dynamic Programming: Applications In Machine Learning and Genomics**: Learn how dynamic programming and Hidden Markov Models can be used to compare genetic strings and uncover evolution.
- **Graph Algorithms in Genome Sequencing**: Learn how graphs are used to assemble millions of pieces of DNA into a contiguous genome and use these genomes to construct a Tree of Life.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures Capstone**: Synthesize your knowledge of algorithms and biology to build your own software for solving a biological challenge.
